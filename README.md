If you want another place in the resort, and have code of it, make an issue in [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/VulcanWM/Besuche-Resort/issues) with the code so I can check it out and add it to the resort. If you do, you will also be mentioned in the credits below. 

If you have any ideas for the game, also make an issue in the GitHub repo above and I'll try to implement it as soon as possible
