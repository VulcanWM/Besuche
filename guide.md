## Items
- **Bank Notes**: They can help you grow your bankspace.
- **Padlock**: If you have a padlock activated, then if someone tries to rob you, they will have to give you some of their money instead. Unfortunately, there is a 1 in 5 chance of the padlock breaking.
- **Camera**: If you have a camera activated, then if someone tries to rob you, they will have to give you all of their money instead. Unfortunately, there is a 1 in 2 chance of the camera breaking. Note that if you have both a camera and padlock activated, the camera will be used first.
- **Fake Id and Robber's Wishlist**: If you have a fake id, your name will be hidden from the money leaderboard so people won't be able to see that you have loads of money, thus won't want to rob you. But if someone has a robber's wishlist, they will be able to see everyone's name in the money leaderboard, including people with a fake id.
